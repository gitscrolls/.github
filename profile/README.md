# 🏛️ Welcome to the House of GitScrolls

> *“Not all repositories are code. Some are scripture.”*

This is the official GitHub organization for **GitScrolls** — a myth-tech codex exploring the spiritual journey of software development.

Here we preserve, illuminate, and extend the sacred teachings of _Tuxicles the Seeker_ — through prose, philosophy, ritual markdown, and absurdly serious commit messages.

---

## 📜 What Are GitScrolls?

**GitScrolls** is a developer scripture told as epic.  
It merges myth and markdown to reveal that version control is not just a tool — it is a path.

- Sixteen scrolls across five acts  
- Characters drawn from open-source archetypes  
- Lessons hidden in lore, commits wrapped in koans  
- A cycle of fall, exile, and return told through Git

## 🧭 What Belongs Here?

The GitScrolls org houses mythic, developer-centered artifacts of:

- Narrative technical philosophy  
- Meditative documentation  
- Sacred markdown & markdown-based rituals  
- Software-adjacent lore that teaches by story  
- Artifacts of reverence for the open-source journey

**It is not:**
- A plugin repo  
- A general-purpose dev blog  
- A free-for-all
